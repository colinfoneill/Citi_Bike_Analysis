Tableau Challenge Analysis

Data Time Frame
    For the purposes of this project, I used January data from 2021 and 2022 in order to create a multi-year analysis on the trends and changes in Citi bike ridership.

Station Heat Map
    The station Heat Map visualizes the most popular starting and ending points in New York. As displayed in the heat map,
    there is considerable crossover between the popular starting stations and the popular ending stations, as is to be expected. 
    The most popular starting station in January '21 and '20 is "1 Ave and E 68 St" and the most popular ending station 
    is Pershing Square North.

2021 vs. 2020
    The 2021 vs. 2020 section of the story displays the changes in ridership from January '20 to January '21. Looking at the raw counts
    of rides, ridership in January '21 decreased by about 12% from January '20. In addition, the proportion of riders who are yearly subscribers
    decreased from 92% in 2020 to 86% in 2021. In tandem with this decrease in the proportion of yearly subscribers, 
    there was an increase in the customer base from 8% to 14%, which are customers who pay for single-use or daily passes (more short-term in nature
    compared to yearly subscribers).

Female Ridership
    As displayed in the female ridership portion of the story, Citi Bike's initiative to increase the proportion of female riders in 2021
    has been effective. The proportion of female riders increased from 22.5% in 2020 to 26.5% in 2021. In addition, the raw number of female
    riders increased despite an overall decrease in ride counts from 2020 to 2021, indicating the female outreach initiative was successful.

Trip Duration by Age
    As expected, younger riders tend to use the bikes for longer duration on average. For all riders the average length of ride settles
    around 750 seconds, or about 12.5 minutes.
